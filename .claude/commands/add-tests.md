description: Generate comprehensive test coverage for the codebase
---

Analyze the current codebase and generate comprehensive tests:

1. Identify untested or under-tested code paths
2. Write unit tests for core functionality
3. Add integration tests for API endpoints
4. Include edge cases and error scenarios
5. Ensure tests are well-documented

Use the project's existing testing framework and follow established patterns.
